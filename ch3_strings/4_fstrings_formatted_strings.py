#f stands for formatted 


#In Python, f-strings (formatted string literals) provide a way to embed expressions inside string literals, using curly braces {}. 
#They are prefixed with an f before the string, allowing you to directly insert variables or expressions within the string,
#making your code cleaner and more readable.

n = input("enter name : ")
s = f"My name is {n}.Do you know any person with name {n}?"
print(s)
